We start by using GPG to encrypt a file with a symmetric cipher.

As a first step we create a file named `document.txt` and some text (*the plaintext*) to it.
This can be done in a variety of ways.

`echo "Here is the plaintext." > document.txt`{{execute}}

Alternatively you can use and editor to create or edit the files: vi, nano, ... are possible alternatives:
`vi document.txt`{{execute}}
